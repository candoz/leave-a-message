# Leave a Message

A location-based textual social network.  
*Leave a Message* is a Single Page Application where the user can leave, comment and like text messages around the world.  

## Motivation

*Leave a Message* was born as a prototype to experiment with the Vue.js framework and HTML5 API for geolocation. 
Particular attention has been paid to the robustness of the application, to the *user experience*, and to the GUI following the *mobile first* and the *responsive design* principles.  
It represents the final project for the *Web Services and Applications* course:
